# Currency-Converter

**Currency calculator** is second website I created. It allows you to convert currencies from PLN EUR GBP CHF. I started creating the website by writing HTML code. Then i added styles in CSS. Next I improved the website by adding the necessary functions. I added a background image of the calculator, Open Graph and a website icon. Below is a gif showing how to use the calculator and a link to the website.
